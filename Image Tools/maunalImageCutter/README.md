# Manual Image Cutter
To use this software, you will need to change the 'srcFoler' to your source folder and 'dstFolder' to the destination folder.

Please notice that you can only cut the image when your 'cutting area' is inside the image. 
It will turn to 'Light Blue' when available.
Otherwise it will be 'Red'.
